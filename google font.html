There are many different dogs from the really big to the small ones. You can train your dog yourself or send it to school in order to make it obedient. Dogs are loyal and reliable animals that people have had as pets for hundreds of years.”

    The above paragraph is a simple example of what a basic paragraph consists. You have the topic sentence to introduce the person to what you’re talking about, and then you have the body of the paragraph, which features the facts and information you have about your topic. After that all you have to do is write a conclusion, which is just restating your topic and the paragraph is finished.
